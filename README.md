# InfocenterAdminInterface

This is a tomcat-based servlet that I wrote to allow the engineers at my employer's company to update their infocenters without needing access to the server running them. It's a rude collection of hacks. I'll update it with instructions for deployment, as well as adding my standard template for the infocenter and its various shell scripts.
